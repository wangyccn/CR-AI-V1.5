[Chinese|简体中文](REAEME-CN.md)

## Introduction

CR-AI-V1.5 is an advanced open-source multimodal large language model that integrates cutting-edge technologies from the contemporary AI landscape. This model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, complemented by optional Longformer attention mechanisms or sparse attention technologies, enabling the model to efficiently process long texts and multimodal information while maintaining high performance.

CR-AI-V1.5 not only inherits the exceptional language understanding and generation capabilities of large language models but further extends its processing abilities to various modal data including images and audio, providing users with a truly multimodal AI assistant. Both in academic research and practical application scenarios, CR-AI-V1.5 has demonstrated remarkable performance.

We believe that open-sourcing CR-AI-V1.5 represents a significant step toward the democratization of artificial intelligence. By opening the source code, we look forward to witnessing the birth of more innovative applications and welcome global developers and researchers to participate in the improvement and optimization of the model.
